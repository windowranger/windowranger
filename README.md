# WindowRanger

> **Stable release:** WindowRanger 1.0.0 is available as a signed and notarized macOS app.

A small, native macOS virtual-workspace manager built around one workflow rather than a
general-purpose command language.

WindowRanger uses three release channels: Stable from `main`, Beta from release branches, and
rolling Dev builds from `develop`. Stable and opt-in Beta builds contain Sparkle update support;
Dev builds remain outside automatic updates. The public signed feed serves Stable and Beta updates
without offering Beta builds to Stable users.

Download the signed and notarized
[`v1.0.0` GitHub release](https://github.com/AppRanger/windowranger/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
as a DMG, with a notarized ZIP as a fallback. GitHub's automatically generated source archives are
not an installable macOS app.

Or install the Stable release from the public AppRanger Homebrew tap:

```sh
brew install --cask appranger/tap/windowranger
```

## Current feature set

- A resumable seven-stage first-run setup for iCloud, Navigate/Arrange shortcuts, Focus Border,
  menu-bar presentation, the Quick App Shelf, and keyboard/trackpad workspace navigation. Every
  choice edits the same setting used by the app; only the wizard's versioned progress remains local.
  General Settings can close Settings and restart the walkthrough from Welcome without resetting
  those choices. The wizard stays above ordinary windows on every macOS Space while shortcuts are
  tested, and its permission status updates automatically after access is granted in System Settings.
- Three native, display-aware menu-bar presentations: Compact by default, Medium chips, or a Full display-grouped workspace strip.
- Full menu-bar workspace hover can use an opt-in interactive desktop preview: the background
  switches workspace and each managed-window item focuses that exact window when it still exists,
  with a same-app fallback if it vanished. Its canvas matches the workspace's resolved home screen,
  preserving that screen's aspect ratio and each window's relative position. Without Screen Recording
  access it remains a metadata-and-icon preview; with the local off-by-default setting it adds the
  home display's current wallpaper when macOS exposes one, plus bounded, one-shot, in-memory window
  thumbnails.
- A standard menu from the primary app item with Settings and a graceful Quit command; the primary item never switches workspaces.
- Virtual workspaces that remember window membership and the active workspace across app restarts.
- Named reusable profiles with local manual/automatic selection, Game Mode, dock and exact-topology triggers, synced abstract display roles, and per-Mac monitor bindings.
- Previewed portable JSON profile export/import that adds fresh reusable definitions without transferring or changing this Mac's active profile, triggers, monitor bindings, runtime workspaces, or open windows.
- Switching parks windows from inactive workspaces at the edge of the desktop and restores their previous frames when returning.
- Workspace switches restore the destination before parking the source, touch only those two workspaces, issue position-only Accessibility writes, and suppress participating apps' own move animation for the duration of each batch.
- Two learnable, configurable global shortcut families: Navigate for finding workspaces and windows,
  and Arrange for moving windows and changing layouts.
- Native sidebar-based, searchable and resizable Settings gives General, Sync, Behavior, Menu Bar,
  Shortcut Guide, and Focus Border their own destinations, separate from reusable configuration
  and controls.
  Workspaces uses a horizontal strip of visual tabs followed by Details, Layout, and Repair panels
  for workspace identity, display home, layout geometry, derived shortcuts, reset, and recovery.
  Wide panes keep their multi-column hierarchy; at compact sizes they stack dense controls instead
  of clipping them. Its sidebar footer identifies
  the running version, build, source commit, and Dev configuration when applicable.
- Two multiple-display modes: unified switching across all displays, or independent active workspaces assigned per display.
- Workspace-local window focus cycling with `Control-Option-,` and `Control-Option-.` by default, wrapping without selecting
  parked windows. A managed standard window that has not yet been activated after restart remains
  reachable when it exposes a writable exact-focus route, while overlays and ambiguous read-only
  surfaces stay excluded.
- Spatial Navigate-arrow focus wraps from an outer workspace edge to the opposite edge without
  crossing the active workspace or display. An open Quick App Shelf uses the same wrapping rule
  along its layout axis and ignores perpendicular arrows.
- Automatic workspace following when a managed window is focused through the Dock or another macOS route.
- Per-workspace Freeform, Tiled, and Accordion layouts with migration-safe persistence, automatic or explicit orientation, gaps, outer padding, Accordion overlap, and stable ordering/weights.
- A searchable global Command Palette with compact Quick Actions, an inline Placement Halo for window positioning, and a runtime Pause command.
- An optional, Mac-local Shortcut Guide that appears while either configured shortcut family is held,
  using a passive bottom key map by default and deriving every visible action from the active
  profile's conflict-checked shortcuts. Compact headings distinguish workspace, window, layout, and
  display targets, while the arrow pad names its spatial focus or reorder behavior below the keys.
  While the Quick App Shelf is open, Navigate changes to a compact Shelf-specific guide on the
  Shelf display: it keeps valid workspace and Commands actions, relabels Shelf traversal and hide,
  shows only the Shelf's usable arrow axis, and moves to the opposite screen edge. Arrange has no
  truthful Shelf-window actions, so its guide stays hidden in that context. It otherwise follows
  the focused window's resolved interaction display and adds rows only when a dense valid
  configuration would otherwise clip actions.
- A profile-aware Quick App Shelf with up to four ordered entries, palette selection, Previous/Next
  Window traversal while open, exact-window presentation, and conservative launch/recovery handling.
- Extensible per-application rules for workspace routing, visibility on every workspace, layout exclusion, and conservative secondary-window floating.
- Per-window floating overrides that retain workspace membership while opting out of Tiled and Accordion.
- Directional focus/reorder, smart resize, workspace reset, and workspace-to-display commands.
- Portable display-home matching using runtime UUID first and conservative hardware fingerprints on reconnect.
- Optional focus-following when moving a window, opt-in hidden-app compatibility, and an explicit native launch-at-login control.
- No native macOS Spaces integration.

Window discovery treats a successful per-application Accessibility window enumeration as the
authoritative lifecycle snapshot for that application. A native tab/window identity absent from a
successful snapshot is removed immediately from the registry, focus history, Tiled tree, and next
persisted state, so closed or inactive tab identities cannot leave ghost layout slots. The narrow
exception is a coordinated successful-empty collapse across at least half of multiple still-running
applications: WindowRanger defers that cohort for 500 milliseconds so a slightly later screen-lock
signal can establish the lifecycle boundary, and while a native fullscreen window remains present
in the current snapshot so a Space transition cannot erase the retained layout tree. A remembered
but currently absent fullscreen window does not create unbounded protection. The first still-collapsed
snapshot after fullscreen receives the same bounded grace. An existing Quick App-owned key also
requires two successful absent snapshots spanning at least 500 milliseconds before its Shelf
ownership is released; exact recovery or process termination resolves that grace immediately, and
an unambiguous native-tab replacement still hands off without delay. A failed or incomplete enumeration is
not evidence that a window closed. Because Accessibility enumeration authority is per application,
not per display, this protection covers only the successfully empty process cohort across the Mac;
currently enumerated windows on another display remain fully manageable. Existing Tiled and Accordion
participants retain their stable layout slots while their geometry writes remain suppressed; an
authoritative minimized, fullscreen, ignored, floating, or layout-excluded state still leaves the
layout immediately.

Default shortcuts:

| Action | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| Switch to workspace | Control-Option-`workspace key` |
| Move focused window | Option-Command-`workspace key` |
| Previous / next workspace | Control-Option-`[` / `]` |
| Switch back and forth | Control-Option-Tab |
| Previous / next window | Control-Option-`,` / `.` |
| Focus left / down / up / right | Control-Option-Left / Down / Up / Right |
| Toggle Quick App | Control-Option-Backtick |
| Open Command Palette | Control-Option-Space |
| Select or rotate Accordion / Tiled | Option-Command-`,` / `.` |
| Toggle focused window floating | Option-Command-F |
| Reorder left / down / up / right | Option-Command-Left / Down / Up / Right |
| Place at a Tiled corner | Option-Command plus two perpendicular arrows within 200 ms |
| Smart resize smaller / larger | Option-Command-`-` / `=` |
| Move current workspace to next display | Option-Command-D |

Navigate and Arrange each have one configurable modifier prefix in Shortcuts Settings. Commands
store only a key suffix, and each workspace stores one suffix that produces a Navigate switch chord
and an Arrange move chord. A suffix must be unique within its family, while the same suffix can be
used deliberately across the two families. Shortcut validation has one shared model for global
commands, the Command Palette trigger, and every derived workspace switch/move chord across every
saved profile. Settings names all commands in a collision and leaves the
conflicting chord unowned until it is repaired; it never silently lets the first command win. If
macOS rejects an otherwise unique global registration (for example because another app owns it),
only that command is skipped and its recorder shows the failure. Other valid shortcuts remain
registered. If the shared event handler itself cannot be installed, registration fails closed rather
than reporting shortcuts that cannot dispatch. Recording temporarily unregisters the app's bindings
and restores them as one clean generation when recording ends; a rare failed OS unregistration is
kept retryable while its old action is made inert immediately.

The four configurable Reorder bindings also form one optional two-arrow family when they use the
same modifiers, have distinct keys, and all register successfully. A first direction waits for its
release or a perpendicular partner for at most 200 ms, so it never moves and then replays a corner
placement. Up+Right, Up+Left, Down+Right, and Down+Left use the matching Tiled compass
placement transaction. Accordion and Freeform report an honest no-op. If the family is incompatible
or macOS cannot observe the bounded gesture, Settings explains why and the ordinary single-arrow
commands continue to work. A successful compass placement is registered with native Undo; the app
menu exposes Undo/Redo while that exact participant set and tree remain current.

General Settings also offers an off-by-default, per-Mac trackpad gesture. Choose three or four
fingers, then swipe horizontally once to move to the adjacent workspace; cycling wraps at both ends.
The gesture dispatches through the same workspace-cycle command as the keyboard, so Independent
Displays continues to use the interaction display. WindowRanger observes without suppressing the
original trackpad event, switches at most once before every finger lifts, and pauses the monitor
during full-screen game, sleep, inactive-session, and shortcut-recording states. This optional path
depends on macOS exposing generic gesture contacts to an Accessibility-authorized event tap; if the
OS does not provide them, Settings reports that workspace swiping is inactive.

## Build

Generate the Xcode project:

```sh
xcodegen generate
```

Open `WindowRanger.xcodeproj`, select a Development Team, and run the `WindowRanger` scheme. The app requests Accessibility access on first launch. iCloud key-value sync requires a signed build with the iCloud capability available to the selected team.

Quit AeroSpace before testing the global shortcuts: macOS lets only one app register a given Carbon hotkey, and the defaults intentionally overlap your AeroSpace bindings.

For side-effect-free automated tests:

```sh
./scripts/verify-test-isolation.sh
xcodebuild -project WindowRanger.xcodeproj -scheme WindowRanger -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO test
```

`./scripts/verify-local-ci.sh --quick` packages those checks into one command. Contributors may opt
this clone into exact-commit pre-push verification with `./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`; the hook
uses an isolated worktree and never builds or launches the app. See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)
for the full local checkpoint and hosted-CI policy.

The unit-test bundle is deliberately non-hosted: it compiles the shared sources directly and
excludes `AppDelegate`, so tests never launch WindowRanger, request Accessibility access, register
hotkeys, manage live windows, or build/register a `WindowRanger.app`. Do not give automated tests a
temporary `-derivedDataPath` and do not add the app target back to the scheme's Test build action.
Xcode's macOS app build step registers every built app with LaunchServices; current Xcode provides no
supported per-build opt-out. App builds should therefore use the normal Xcode DerivedData location,
while background verification should invoke the isolated Test action above.

The three menu-bar components also have an opt-in offscreen Retina fixture built from the production
views. It runs in the same non-hosted test bundle and does not start the app or Accessibility paths:

```sh
./scripts/render-menu-bar-previews.sh /path/to/output-directory
```

The selected visual-tab Workspaces Settings screen has the same isolated production-render path:

```sh
./scripts/render-settings-preview.sh /path/to/output-directory
```

That command renders the selected visual-tab screen in wide and minimum-width Light/Dark states,
plus wide and minimum-width Dark fixtures with nine workspaces and a selected long name. The focused
scope is the script default, so the documented command reproduces the overflow evidence directly.

The seven production onboarding stages can likewise be rendered without starting the app:

```sh
./scripts/render-onboarding-previews.sh /path/to/output-directory
```

The current selected-reference review and durable output paths are recorded in `design-qa.md`.

The scheme runs as **WindowRanger Dev** from Xcode with the development-only
`dev.appranger.WindowRanger.Debug` identity, and archives **WindowRanger** as **Release** with the
public `dev.appranger.WindowRanger` identity. Their Accessibility grants, preferences, recovery
state, diagnostics and command sockets are separate; Debug is local-only and cannot access the
public iCloud store. Only one copy should run at a time; the development handoff scripts enforce
that boundary. Debug app runs write structured JSON
Lines diagnostics to
`~/Library/Logs/dev.appranger.WindowRanger.Debug/diagnostics.jsonl`; the file rotates at 1 MB and retains two
1 MB backups. Release builds do not create this verbose file. Unit tests use memory or no-op loggers
and never write there.

Option-clicking the status item in every build reveals **Copy Focused Window Diagnostic Report**.
It snapshots the externally focused window before the menu opens and copies a bounded, versioned,
read-only report covering Accessibility reads, admission, workspace/layout state, expected versus
observed geometry, and only related recent in-memory command events. It never focuses, raises,
moves, resizes, admits, or unparks the subject. Review the privacy header before sharing. Debug
builds additionally reveal **Copy Recent Diagnostics** (a bounded recent excerpt with its privacy
notice) and **Reveal Diagnostics File** for that menu opening. Opening the menu normally keeps those
support controls hidden. Diagnostics contain action/session
IDs, bundle identifiers, internal window/workspace/display IDs, layout decisions, frames, and AX
success/failure results. Startup diagnostics and the focused-window report also record whether
macOS **Displays have separate Spaces** is enabled, so focus and cross-display reports retain that
otherwise invisible system context without changing the setting or treating it as display topology.
They do not collect window titles, document names, URLs, typed content,
full file paths, or window contents.

Focused report schema 3 also retains the trigger for an active fixed-size recovery state: the
classification time and source, resize outcome, available original/requested/observed frames,
size baseline, last capability probe and current recovery gate. This evidence lasts as long as
the recovery state, even when the failure happened during background layout without a command
correlation. It adds no window writes and does not change when a window is floated or recovered.

Copied diagnostics are line-safe and action-aware: the latest correlated hotkeys and their resulting
focus/layout events are retained separately from the noisy file tail, so ordinary background polling
cannot evict the trigger. Background layout enforcement is input-driven rather than timer-driven;
an unchanged poll performs no layout writes, and an app that rejects a target frame is retried only
after a relevant geometry input changes or the user explicitly requests the layout again.

## Profiles

A profile is a reusable configuration, never a snapshot of open windows. Each profile contains its
ordered workspace definitions and keys, per-workspace layout and geometry, Unified or Independent
Displays mode, abstract display roles and workspace-role homes, the complete app-rule collection
including paused rules, and an ordered shelf of up to four Quick Apps with presentation settings
owned once by the shelf. Each Quick App entry contains only its application identity and position
in that order. An application is either a Quick App or has normal App Rules within one profile, never
both. Exact
open-window IDs, workspace membership, frames, and focus remain local session state and are not
copied into a profile.

The profile Quick App Shelf is a temporary workspace containing the eligible admitted windows of
its configured applications. It can use non-overlapping Carousel cards or an overlapping Accordion,
with a configured maximum of one to four visible apps. Every eligible window from each visible
application's one running process participates in that layout; the maximum counts applications,
not windows. WindowRanger never launches extra apps merely to fill the shelf. The explicitly
selected app retains the existing bounded launch behaviour.

The regular shortcut defaults to Navigate-Backtick and toggles the currently selected entry.
The Command Palette can show a specific entry or select the previous/next entry in the stable
configured order. Selection is remembered locally
for each profile without reordering its synced shelf. Opening the Command Palette keeps an already
presented shelf visible. While the shelf is presented, the normal Previous Window and Next Window
shortcuts temporarily cycle through each app's windows and then the configured app order instead of
the underlying workspace; moving to an
already visible neighbour promotes it without closing the shelf. Navigate plus an arrow instead
uses the visible Shelf geometry to focus the nearest entry in that direction, making the Shelf a
contained temporary workspace. Reaching either end of the Shelf's visual axis wraps to its opposite
edge; perpendicular arrows do nothing and never escape to a managed window behind it. The palette
retains keyboard focus
while entries are previewed, and closing it focuses the currently selected entry. The selected app
optionally expands the shelf from a chosen screen edge, defaulting to a roll-down from the top at
full usable width and 80 percent height. Left and right presentations use the same percentage as
screen width. Carousel divides the shelf across the other axis, while Accordion leaves a reachable
edge of each overlapping neighbour and keeps the selected window foremost. Every edge animation
collapses within the selected display, so a neighbouring monitor
never becomes an off-screen travel path. With animation disabled, WindowRanger applies the final
frames directly. Pressing the shortcut again or focusing another app uses macOS Hide for each
presented Quick App application, avoiding the Dock minimize animation; showing prepares the Shelf
frames before unhiding the application. Because Hide is application-wide, every owned window from
that app shares one visibility transition while retaining its own exact frame and workspace restore
state. When the focused-window border is enabled, Quick App uses
the same four-point screen-edge clearance as managed layouts so the complete border remains visible;
toggling the border setting updates an already presented Quick App immediately. While owned,
those windows stay outside normal workspace layout, reset, ordinary focus cycling, and frame
persistence. A newly admitted eligible same-process window joins its application's exact Shelf
group; closing one member releases only that window while another member remains. Native-tab
replacement may transfer the removed window's local restore state only through the existing exact,
authoritative same-process handoff boundary. Whenever write-enabled discovery finds an eligible
configured Quick App without Shelf ownership, it claims the application hidden before ordinary
workspace layout. This also handles windows that arrive after startup or resume; existing presented
Shelf sessions are left alone. Paused/read-only discovery and unresolved window state do not hide
applications. Exact WindowRanger-owned windows whose application remains hidden retain that ownership. The hidden
ownership marker is local to the current WindowServer session and is discarded rather than applied
to a different window identity. Legacy minimized-window markers do not grant permission to unhide
an application. Matching windows from multiple processes remain ambiguous and fail closed because
one application-level visibility transition cannot govern them truthfully.
If the configured app has no available window, pressing the Quick App shortcut normally opens and
activates it so apps that create a window only when foregrounded receive their normal reopen request.
Palette-owned shelf previews launch without taking keyboard focus from the palette.
WindowRanger waits briefly for at least one eligible window, then claims every matching window from
that application process before ordinary layout can move them. A missing installation, launch
failure, timeout, or matching windows split across multiple processes produces clear feedback
instead of guessing or retrying indefinitely.
Profiles can choose different ordered shelves and shared shelf presentation. These are managed in
the dedicated Quick App Shelf Settings section, while shortcuts remain global preferences. Existing
profiles migrate the first configured Quick App's presentation to the shared shelf setting.
For the app that owns the focused window, Command Palette can add it directly to the active
profile's normal Applications list or App Shelf. When it already has an Application Rule, the
palette can remove that rule; searches for either Add or Remove expose the explicitly labelled
inverse action with an Already in Applications explanation. Moving between Applications and Shelf
is labelled explicitly because one profile never stores the same app in both. A companion host
whose tagged surfaces are ignored cannot enter App Shelf because Shelf visibility controls an
entire application process.
WindowRanger omits neighbours whose matching windows span multiple processes and reports a clear
no-op rather than trying to control those separate application lifecycles as one Shelf entry.

Profile definitions are stored as one versioned value and sync atomically through iCloud when sync is
enabled. New installations start local-only until **Sync settings with iCloud** is explicitly enabled.
Enabling sync first requests and validates the existing cloud profile library; that first pull is
read-only, and all local cloud writes remain blocked until a valid library arrives. An immediate
empty read is treated as unresolved because iCloud delivery can be delayed. If the account is
actually empty—or this Mac must deliberately become the source of truth—**Replace iCloud with This
Mac’s Settings…** is a separately confirmed action and is available before enabling the ordinary
pull. Turning sync off stops cloud reads and writes without deleting local settings or previously
synced cloud data. The Sync pane lists the complete boundary: the profile library, Menu Bar presentation,
global shortcuts, Command Palette activation, focus-following moves, and automatic app unhide can
sync. This Mac always keeps its active profile and manual pin, automatic trigger mappings,
per-profile active workspace state and selected Quick App, conservative monitor fingerprints and
role-to-monitor bindings, trackpad, Shortcut Guide and Focus Border appearance, permissions,
login-item state, live-window state, and diagnostics locally. iCloud key-value storage does not expose a trustworthy
participating-device list, so WindowRanger does not pretend to list synced Macs. A missing,
disconnected, or ambiguous role safely falls back without rewriting the synced role assignment.

The atomic synced profile-library value is limited to 750,000 encoded bytes, 128 profiles, 128
workspaces and 64 display roles per profile, 512 app rules per profile, and 256 characters per
user-facing name. These deliberately leave room inside iCloud key-value storage's shared 1 MB quota.
Existing local private-install data is never deleted or truncated to meet a sync limit. If a local
or remote library exceeds a limit, the local library remains authoritative and General Settings
shows the reason; when the local copy is valid, recovery requires the explicit confirmed replacement
action rather than an ordinary edit or sync toggle.

Automatic selection resolves in a fixed order: a manual pin; this Mac's profile for a foreground
full-screen declared-game session; an exact known display topology; a generic docked or undocked
rule on portable Macs; then this Mac's default profile. A manual selection
cannot be cleared by wake, timers, or later display events—choose **Resume Automatic** in Profile
Settings or the app menu to release it. A portable Mac with only its built-in display is undocked; a
portable Mac with an external display is docked. Desktop Macs skip that generic distinction.

Profiles Settings combines the reusable library with this Mac's automatic-use assignments. Large
icon-and-name tabs select what to edit, a trailing add tab creates another reusable profile, and the
selected profile can be duplicated, renamed, safely deleted, imported, or exported. Its icon follows
the reusable profile into the Settings selector, cloning, sync, and portable transfer. Selecting,
creating, or duplicating a profile changes only the Settings edit target; **Use Profile** remains the
explicit action that activates it and pins it on this Mac until automatic selection resumes.

The same Profiles page assigns the selected profile to this Mac's Default, Game Mode, docked,
undocked, and exact display-setup contexts. Each context has one owner: moving an assignment from
another profile is explicit, Default cannot be unassigned, and the optional assignments can be
removed by selecting their checked row again. Assigning the current display setup moves an existing
matching topology instead of creating a duplicate. These assignments remain local even though the
reusable profile definitions may sync or be exported. Displays owns the selected profile's Unified
or Independent mode and abstract
display-role names alongside this Mac's physical monitor bindings. Workspaces, Applications, Quick
App Shelf, Displays, and profile-owned Menu Bar icons all follow the independent Settings edit
selection. Switching profiles first recovers eligible managed
windows to meaningful visible frames,
then applies the destination workspaces, display state, and app rules. Still-open windows are routed
by destination app rules or conservatively placed on an active destination workspace rather than
retaining membership from the old profile. Ignored panels and temporarily unsafe minimized or
full-screen windows remain untouched. The app menu shows the active profile and its selection reason
and provides quick switching without making the primary menu-bar item a workspace action.

On the first profile-capable launch, the existing private installation's reusable configuration is
backed up, converted into **Current Setup**, saved in the new profile format, and decoded back for
verification before the old settings keys and backup are removed. Profile-backed storage is then the
sole configuration authority.

## Workspace Settings

Workspaces is the single place for workspace-specific configuration. A full-row profile selector in
the Settings sidebar makes the owner explicit and provides the same non-activating selection used by
Displays, Applications, and Quick App Shelf. Explicit activation remains in Profile Status rather
than appearing as another sidebar row. The normal Settings sidebar stays on the left. A horizontally
scrollable row of large workspace tabs shows each workspace's name, key, and a reusable desktop
preview. Active-profile tabs may read the engine's existing managed-window metadata and reuse the
same optional in-memory thumbnails as menu-bar hover; inactive-profile tabs retain the truthful
saved Freeform, Tiled, or Accordion miniature. Selecting a Settings tab only changes what is edited
and never activates a live workspace. The selected workspace's compact Details panel sits beside the wider Layout and Repair
inspector. At compact widths the same panels stack beneath the tab strip, and paired geometry
controls stack when horizontal room runs out. The page owns workspace names/order/keys, abstract
Home Display roles, Freeform/Tiled/Accordion choice, orientation, Tiled
gaps and screen padding, Accordion visible-edge padding, and both reusable-setting reset and live
window recovery. Profiles remains separate for reusable profile management, Displays owns the
profile's display mode and this Mac's physical monitor bindings, and Shortcuts remains separate for
global commands.

Tiled geometry uses two compact visual editors instead of an undifferentiated list of numbers. A
tile preview distinguishes horizontal and vertical inner gaps, while an inset-screen preview maps
Top, Right, Bottom, and Left outer padding to their physical edges. Every point value remains
directly editable. Optional **Keep equal** controls link values only for the current Settings edit;
they reset when the inspected workspace changes and add no profile or iCloud state. Link activation
does not migrate untouched pre-upgrade geometry, and linked multi-value changes participate in
native Undo.

Each workspace key produces read-only summaries of the exact derived commands: Navigate-key
switches to it and Arrange-key sends the focused window there. Add and Duplicate resolve a
unique name and supported key automatically. Shortcut updates preserve unchanged system
registrations and add or remove only the affected workspace bindings, so edits take effect without
relaunching. Drag reorder, context-menu Move Left/Right, VoiceOver
Move earlier/later,
safe deletion, native Undo for **Reset This Workspace**, and **Restore WindowRanger Defaults** all
use the same profile-backed storage path. **Copy Layout** copies another workspace's layout style,
orientation, gaps, and padding without changing identity, display home, app rules, or window
membership. Displays is a current destination; saved or deep-linked
legacy Layouts selections open Workspaces instead of leaving a stale destination.

## Command Palette and Window Placement

The Command Palette is a global interaction preference, not part of a profile. Its shortcut uses
the shared key-suffix map and conflict model, using **Navigate-Space** by default. It opens a
keyboard-focused search field containing the
commands currently valid for the focused window, workspace, layout, profile, and interaction
display. A compact **Quick Actions** block directly below search keeps workspace-wide layout and
focused-window placement visually separate from the command results. Its first row shows the
current workspace's **Freeform**, **Tiled**, or **Accordion** layout and changes it without closing
the palette. Its second row opens focused-window placement only when truthful placements exist.
Results also show their configured shortcuts where one exists. Arrow keys move selection, Return
runs it, and Escape or a second shortcut press closes the palette.

Command Palette Settings can place the panel at the **Top**, **Centre**, or **Bottom** of the
interaction display. **Top** preserves the original default. This display-geometry preference stays
on the current Mac, follows the display captured before WindowRanger becomes key, and keeps both the
ordinary palette and its expanded Placement Halo inside that display's usable area.

**Pause WindowRanger** is a transient runtime state available from the palette and app menu. While
paused, only the Command Palette shortcut remains registered; the palette offers only **Resume
WindowRanger**. Workspace swipes, shortcut guidance, focus highlighting, automatic visibility and
layout writes, and menu-bar workspace actions remain inactive. WindowRanger takes a read-only window
snapshot on resume so Tiled and Accordion changes made while paused are not learned, then reconciles
the current profile and layout once. Freeform windows remain user-positioned. Pause is never saved or
synced and always starts off after relaunch.

Opening a key window must not retarget a window-management command to WindowRanger itself. The
palette therefore captures the external interaction context and frontmost application first. It
revalidates the exact window, workspace, display, layout, profile, and generated placement token
while its external-focus lease is still active. Ordinary commands then close the palette, restore
the preceding application, and dispatch; placement remains queued before dismissal so its target
cannot be replaced by focus restoration. A changed or unavailable target cancels safely.

The **Place focused window** Quick Action expands a compact **Placement Halo** from its row without
closing the palette. It contains only Loop-style positions that can be previewed truthfully for the
focused window: Freeform halves and quarters or Tiled compass placement. Layout selection,
Accordion resizing, and every other former wheel command remain searchable palette actions, while
the current workspace layout is always visible above them. When no position is available, the
entire placement row is omitted instead of showing a disabled or invented choice.

Tab enters Quick Actions without moving focus away from search. Up from the first command result
enters the visually adjacent bottom Quick Action, then Up and Down move through its stacked rows.
Left and Right change layout only while the workspace-layout row is selected. Return on the
placement row opens the Halo, whose arrow keys move around the available positions. Return commits
the highlighted placement, and Escape collapses the Halo or returns from Quick Actions to command
results. Typing hides Quick Actions and any open Halo so filtering becomes the only active mode;
clearing the query shows them again. Pointer use remains available at the same time. The
expanded transparent panel disables its AppKit window shadow so macOS does not draw an outline
around the halo; the halo retains its own bounded material shadow.

Legacy saved wheel ordering and press/hold preferences remain decodable so existing settings are
not damaged, but the current UI and runtime no longer expose the broad wheel catalogue. The obsolete
Globe/Fn preference and input-monitor implementation have been removed. Command Palette Settings now contains its enablement and a read-only resolved
shortcut summary; the shared action assignment is edited in Shortcuts.
window placement is offered contextually inside the palette itself.

The spatial interaction/provider contract remains documented in
[Contextual Radial Menu](docs/radial-menu-design.md). Its subordinate
[Radial Tiled Placement](docs/radial-tiled-placement.md) contract defines compass-style choices that
preview deterministic tiled-tree transformations without Accessibility writes, then commit the
validated proposal through one normal layout transaction. Tree state remains local to the current
WindowServer session and never becomes synced profile configuration.

## Command-line tool and agent skill

WindowRanger includes a separately signed `windowranger` helper inside the app. General Settings can
add a user-owned link at `~/.local/bin/windowranger` and, only when needed, an exact managed PATH
block to zsh or bash's login file. It does not require administrator access, replace an existing
command, or overwrite unrelated shell configuration. Removing it deletes only WindowRanger's exact
link and managed block. Open a new terminal after changing PATH.

The helper exposes both the familiar shortcuts and the complete first-party action/configuration
surface:

```text
windowranger status [--json]
windowranger capabilities [--json]
windowranger workspaces [--names] [--json]
windowranger workspace <id-or-key> [--json]
windowranger layout <freeform|tiled|accordion> [--json]
windowranger pause [--json]
windowranger resume [--json]
windowranger actions [--json]
windowranger action <name> [--args <json>] [--json]
windowranger config get [--json]
windowranger config validate <file|-> [--json]
windowranger config apply <file|-> --replace [--json]
windowranger skill [--output <directory-or-SKILL.md> [--force]]
```

The helper is a thin client to the one running app and uses the same command dispatcher as in-app
controls. `actions` discovers every stable user-facing runtime and system action. `config get`
returns a versioned snapshot of all persisted WindowRanger settings, including reusable profiles and
machine-local choices. Applying a configuration is deliberately a whole-document replacement: the
caller must validate it, preserve its optimistic revision, and explicitly pass `--replace`, so an
older export cannot silently overwrite newer edits. Enabling iCloud is kept out of whole-document
replacement because joining may pull a different cloud library: it uses the separately confirmed
`enable-icloud-sync` action, after which callers must fetch a fresh snapshot. Destructively replacing
the cloud copy likewise requires the exact `replace-icloud-with-local` confirmation token.

`--json` returns a bounded versioned envelope with code-only errors. Workspace IDs and keys are
available for exact targeting; user-authored names are omitted from the convenience workspace list
unless `--names` is supplied. Complete configuration output is intentionally private and includes
user-authored names, app bundle identifiers and local display bindings; callers should avoid
retaining or publishing it.
`windowranger skill` prints a deterministic, privacy-safe `SKILL.md`, or writes it to a requested
agent-skill directory without copying runtime workspace or window data. Existing files are refused
unless `--force` is explicit, and symbolic-link destinations are always refused.

## Current behaviour and limits

Window membership, original positions, per-window floating overrides, and the active workspace are saved locally in `~/Library/Caches/<bundle-identifier>/workspace-state.json` for the active profile, so Debug and Release recovery state remain separate. On a normal quit, the state is saved before every managed window is made visible again. On the next launch, exact window-ID and app-bundle matches are returned only when the saved profile and WindowServer session remain valid; the previously active workspace is shown, and inactive workspaces are parked again.

The AppRanger identity migration copies missing preferences and the current-session recovery cache
from `com.windowranger.WindowRanger` once, without deleting or overwriting either identity's data.
The iCloud key-value entitlement deliberately continues using the existing WindowRanger store so
opt-in synced settings remain available. Because macOS treats the new signed identifier as a new
application identity, users upgrading from an older Beta must grant Accessibility access again and
reconfirm Launch at Login if they use it.

Recovery-state replacement is atomic and private to the user. A failed write remains retryable, an
externally removed cache file is recreated on the next persistence tick even when workspace state has
not changed, and corrupt, oversized, wrong-version, or wrong-WindowServer-session data is ignored
rather than trusted.

Window IDs are only trusted inside the same WindowServer session. After logout, reboot, or a WindowServer restart, stale assignments are ignored rather than guessed. If a crash or Xcode Stop leaves a window parked, the continuously saved state normally reconstructs it on the next launch; an unmatched parked window is instead recovered to the main display.

Sleep/wake recovery is lifecycle-driven rather than left to the background window poll. Before sleep,
the app persists workspace intent and invalidates delayed focus/layout work. Wake, screen-wake, user-
session activation, and display-topology notifications coalesce into one generation: portable monitor
homes resolve first, fresh Accessibility window lists are acquired next, and visibility/layout is
applied from the stable snapshot. A changed topology or temporarily incomplete AX enumeration gets
at most two bounded retries. The resulting Tiled and Accordion frames are then read back over a
bounded period; only split windows that remain eligible and do not match the solved frame are retried.
Minimized, full-screen, floating, ignored, disappeared, or still-unresponsive windows are left
untouched rather than being moved from stale AX elements. A changed WindowServer session keeps the
active workspace intent but discards unsafe exact window IDs.

Native macOS full-screen windows use an explicit fail-closed session. A true Accessibility full-screen
observation enters immediately; failed or unsupported reads retain an existing session, and two
consecutive authoritative false reads are required to leave it. During the session WindowRanger
performs no position or size writes for that window. For apps declaring Game Mode support or a Games
category, foreground sessions also suppress the Command Palette and command-feedback panels, retain
only workspace-navigation hotkeys, reserve Command-Escape for macOS Game Overlay, and reduce broad
window discovery while still checking promptly for full-screen exit. Returning to the workspace
focuses the native full-screen window without restoring a frame or moving it between displays.
The optional local Game Mode profile mapping requires a foreground full-screen game whose bundle
explicitly declares `LSSupportsGameMode`. Public macOS APIs do not expose the user's live per-game Game Mode override, so WindowRanger
does not claim to observe that private system state directly.

Lifecycle wiring follows Apple's documented notification centers and boundaries:
[NSWorkspace willSleep](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsworkspace/willsleepnotification),
[didWake](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsworkspace/didwakenotification),
[sessionDidBecomeActive](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsworkspace/sessiondidbecomeactivenotification),
and AppKit's main-actor
[didChangeScreenParameters](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/didchangescreenparametersnotification).

Inactive windows are parked at the lower-right desktop edge because public macOS APIs do not provide a per-window hide operation. Unified mode keeps one active workspace across every display. Independent Displays mode gives each display its own active workspace and assigns each workspace an abstract display-role home. Role assignments sync with their profile, while this Mac retains the physical UUID/fingerprint binding locally; a disconnected role falls back safely and returns on reconnect. The Settings recovery button restores every tracked window; if a prior crash or force-stop left only a parked coordinate to recover, it centers that window on the main display without resizing it. A normal app quit performs the same cleanup. Animation suppression is temporary and app-scoped; it does not change macOS system animation or Accessibility settings.

Layout is selected independently for each workspace. **Freeform** preserves manual window frames and stops automatic positioning or resizing; its contextual Place wheel can explicitly snap only the focused window to a usable-screen half or quarter, with an exact preview and Undo. WindowRanger still manages workspace visibility, focus, persistence, display assignment, and quit/wake recovery. Tiled uses a session-local, non-overlapping binary split tree derived migration-safely from stable order and per-window weight. Manually resizing a focused tile temporarily parks only the participating real windows, leaving the desktop visible through lightly bordered, click-through clear-glass hints that follow the pointer; releasing snaps the real windows directly into the proposed split, while cancellation restores their exact original frames. A title-bar drag keeps the real layout visible and shows one accent-glass landing region: a target centre swaps leaves, while its four edges insert the dragged leaf beside it. A drag can cross displays from Tiled, Accordion, or Freeform and hands the window to the destination workspace's own layout: Tiled inserts it into that display's tree, Accordion appends and focuses it in the stack, and Freeform keeps the manually dragged frame. The source layout closes the gap using its own rules. Unified retains the window's workspace, while Independent Displays transfers it to that display's active workspace. Contextual edge/corner placement previews and commits through the same tree calculation. Accordion follows the current AeroSpace-style overlapping stack with the focused window promoted to its primary pane. Both automatic layouts can resolve orientation from the display shape or use an explicit horizontal/vertical direction, with per-workspace inner gaps, outer screen padding, and configurable Accordion visible-edge padding. In Unified mode each display's windows are laid out separately according to saved display affinity; Independent Displays mode lays the workspace out only on its assigned display. The persisted raw value remains `none`, so existing and legacy saved definitions migrate without changing behavior.

Tiled and Accordion preserve AppKit's menu-bar, camera-housing, and visible-Dock safe edges. When the
user's Dock preference is auto-hide, WindowRanger deliberately restores only the configured Dock
edge to the full display boundary; this avoids retaining AppKit's transient Dock reveal strip after
leaving a full-screen game. Changing Dock hiding or its bottom/left/right orientation is picked up by
the normal display refresh and does not require relaunching WindowRanger.

Arrange-comma selects Accordion and Arrange-period selects Tiled. Selecting a different layout keeps
its saved orientation, or uses Automatic for an unconfigured workspace. Pressing the same direct
shortcut again alternates the visible layout between horizontal and vertical; an Automatic
orientation first resolves from the interaction display and then changes to the opposite concrete
direction. Tiled orientation changes retain the session tree's window identities, topology and
ratios rather than rebuilding membership or focus.

Arrange-F toggles only the focused managed window between Floating and the workspace layout. Enabling Floating captures the current frame and leaves the window in its workspace while the remaining windows reflow; disabling it immediately returns the window to Tiled or Accordion. The override is restored only when the exact window ID and bundle identifier still match within the same WindowServer session, and is discarded with other stale window state. An app-level layout-exclusion rule is authoritative: the shortcut makes no contradictory override and the menu-bar icon briefly explains why. A window authoritatively proven movable but not resizable also cannot be forced into layout; Arrange-F explains that it must remain floating. A structurally proven standard-window dialog likewise stays floating at its application-chosen size.

Dialogs use the same managed workspace membership, visibility, focus, display affinity, persistence, and quit recovery as normal windows, but high-confidence dialogs float automatically so they do not distort Tiled or Accordion. High-confidence signals are an Accessibility sheet role, a system-dialog subrole, a layer-0 dialog/floating-window subrole corroborated by reliable window-control metadata, a standard window with absent Full Screen/Close controls and either affirmative window-level Default and Cancel relationships or AppKit's native `open-panel`/`save-panel` Accessibility identifier, or a layer-0 standard window that has a Close control, can move, and authoritatively cannot resize. The native-panel identifier is reduced immediately to a privacy-safe true/false observation; no arbitrary identifier is retained or logged. These cases cover native Open/Save panels without inspecting localized titles, button labels, dimensions, file paths, or application identity. They and proven fixed-size windows use position-only writes, cannot consume a layout slot, and cannot be forced into one, preserving native dialog size. Each candidate gets one support probe, so an unsupported or failed relationship/identifier/capability read stays conservative without adding repeated Accessibility traffic. In the current local candidate, rejected or ignored writes on normally admitted windows retain their tiled membership. Observed size limits provisionally constrain the split, so a window that accepts only 600 points keeps that space and its neighbour gets the remainder after gaps. Unsettled requests have bounded retries. If all windows cannot fit, the engine preserves a valid previous layout or their current sizes rather than dropping a participant. Native repeated-resize and double-click validation remains open. A known nonzero-layer Accessibility dialog is left untouched until its live layer metadata settles, preventing transient prompts from entering a split; an unknown layer remains conservatively managed. Other ambiguous dialog-like windows remain in the layout, and a missing or failed Accessibility read is never treated as positive evidence. Verified nonzero-layer Codex transient panels remain ignored entirely.

A formerly fixed-size standard window can return to tiling after an actual size change while visible on an active workspace and fresh confirmation that it can both move and resize. The WR-123 local candidate also provides up to three delayed size-only trials for windows classified after ineffective resize writes. Trials require an idle, visible managed window and fresh writable capabilities; only an observed size response permits layout reentry. Truly non-resizable capability classifications retain the original protection, and repeated ignored trials stop. **Live validation remains open:** Stable 1.0.9 reports capture Slack and Chrome becoming stuck after ignored resize writes. The candidate passes deterministic recovery and safety tests but has not yet demonstrated recovery during the original live recurrence. Successful tiling after restart does not establish that result.

Layout precedence is explicit and deterministic: an app-level **Do not include in Tiled or Accordion** rule wins first; proven fixed-size and standard-window-dialog safety win next; a per-window Arrange-F choice wins over other automatic behavior; verified dialog floating follows; an opt-in per-app **Float detected dialogs and secondary windows** rule can also float conservatively ambiguous dialog-like metadata; otherwise a normal window participates in layout. The secondary-window rule never uses titles and never infers secondary ownership from size or non-resizability alone; authoritative structural or move/resize evidence instead decides whether a standard window can safely participate in layout at all. Pressing Arrange-F on another automatically floated dialog forces it into the current layout, and pressing it again makes it explicitly floating. Only the explicit per-window choice persists for the exact window ID within the current WindowServer session. Automatic classification is reevaluated from live metadata and is never copied onto a newly created window ID.

Externally hidden applications remain tracked so their workspace and restore state survive Hide,
but their ordinary windows reserve no layout space, receive no focus target, and receive no geometry
writes while the application is hidden. Hiding an app immediately reflows the remaining visible
windows; unhiding it returns its retained windows through the normal current/inactive-workspace
visibility path. This is separate from WindowRanger-owned Quick App hiding and does not treat Hide
as termination or a failed Accessibility snapshot.

Application Rules are selected from installed or currently running apps and are stored by bundle identifier rather than file path. The picker groups open apps first. When an open app's managed windows all belong to one WindowRanger workspace, a newly created rule starts with that workspace assigned; windowless apps and apps split across multiple workspaces retain the conservative **Use current workspace** default. A workspace assignment routes newly discovered windows to that workspace; in Independent Displays mode it also follows that workspace's display home. You can still move an individual window elsewhere manually, and that override survives routine window refreshes. Moving it back to the assigned workspace clears the override; changing the App Rule or profile, resetting its workspace, reopening the window, or choosing Reset All Windows reapplies the rule. Keep on all workspaces takes precedence over assignment, prevents parking, and preserves the window's existing display affinity. Layout exclusion leaves the app's windows at their current frames while the remaining windows participate in Tiled or Accordion. Secondary-window floating is narrower and preserves ordinary document-window layout participation. No rules are created during migration, so existing behavior is unchanged until a rule is added.

Rules can be paused without deleting their saved actions. Rule edits apply immediately to managed windows and participate in the Settings window's normal Command-Z Undo chain. Disabled rules remain persisted and synced, but resolve to no behavior until resumed.

Every explicit Settings command reassigns the existing Settings utility to the current WindowRanger
workspace and interaction display, then brings it to the front. If that window was already visible
on another native macOS Space, WindowRanger resets that old Space attachment before showing the same
window on the current Space. WindowRanger lets the originating status-item click finish before
presenting its detached menu, then a Settings selection waits until that popup has fully returned
before activating the utility. This releases menu-bar input ownership before Settings becomes key
and frontmost, so global shortcuts remain available. Closing and reopening Settings reuses and
raises SwiftUI's retained window immediately; if macOS has released it, WindowRanger requests a new
Settings scene. Returning to a workspace in the background still restores Settings without stealing
focus.

Shortcuts Settings owns the global Navigate and Arrange modifier prefixes and the key-only action map. Recording a key suffix temporarily suspends WindowRanger's Carbon registrations and rejects conflicts with workspace or other command bindings; actions can also be reset or left unassigned for palette-only use. Workspaces owns each profile workspace's one suffix and shows both derived family chords; no default chord is invented for selecting Freeform.

Moving a focused window is send-only by default: the source workspace remains active and focus moves to the next eligible visible window on the same interaction display. **Focus follows moved window** is opt-in in Behavior, and the Command Palette always offers a one-shot **Move & Follow** action. If no local source window remains, internal focus state is cleared rather than selecting a parked or other-display fallback. Focus Border can also opt this Mac into a click-through focused-window border with its own local colour, defaulting to light blue independently of the menu bar's white highlight default. Independent local filters can limit the border to Tiled workspaces, workspaces with multiple managed windows, or both. While enabled, Tiled and Accordion reserve four points at each screen edge for the border even when a filter currently hides it; Freeform frames remain user-controlled. The border uses a conservative default corner radius selected by macOS generation because public window metadata does not expose another app's rendered corner radius: macOS 27 and later use 16 points, while earlier releases retain the 10-point fallback. Focus Border owns optional application-specific radius overrides on this Mac. They are independent of profile-owned Application Rules and Quick Apps, so removing or converting either does not erase the local appearance correction. The border also hides for WindowRanger-owned windows, apps identified as games through public bundle metadata, full-screen windows, and while the session is suspended.

Menu-bar presentation is selected in Menu Bar Settings and syncs with other global settings through iCloud when enabled. **Compact** (the migration-safe default) adapts to the workspace-label choice for each connected logical display: a shortcut key sits in a symbol-specific safe area inside the horizontal-monitor, vertical-monitor, laptop, or combined-display symbol, while a compacted name appears as bare text beside a smaller symbol. It adds no status dot or enclosing badge. Name labels retain up to five characters rather than collapsing to the shortest pressure abbreviation. If that display role's icon is set to None, Compact keeps the workspace key or name as bare text. **Medium** uses an equal-height chip for every display's full active-workspace label. In both modes the interaction display receives a restrained accent, every indicator is informational, and every item opens the app menu. **Full** uses lightweight display groups containing explicit workspace actions; only a primary click on a workspace switches to it. A primary click on the app or display area where present, a secondary click anywhere, or the primary VoiceOver action opens the app menu. Independent Displays shows each connected display's own active workspace simultaneously, while Unified uses one combined-displays signal and one workspace set. Each profile display role has its own Automatic, Horizontal Monitor, Vertical Monitor, Laptop, or None icon choice in Menu Bar Settings. The choice follows profile cloning, transfer, and optional iCloud sync; the actual monitor binding remains local to each Mac and is edited in Displays. Automatic derives the display-aware symbol from the monitor currently bound to the role. None removes only that display block's icon and gap while retaining workspace labels, controls, menu ownership, and accessibility context. Unified keeps one Automatic combined-displays symbol because its block does not represent one physical display. Menu Bar Settings renders these same production display groups on every supported macOS release.

Full workspace segments show an immediate restrained rollover so the pointer target is clear before clicking. After a short hover, a nonactivating Liquid Glass shelf lists the managed apps assigned directly to that workspace; selecting one switches to the workspace and focuses that app without allowing the shelf itself to take focus. Multiple managed windows from the same app appear as one row with a count, and an empty workspace is stated explicitly without an unnecessary scrollbar. Longer lists scroll only when they exceed the bounded eight-row viewport. macOS 14–25 use the system menu material where native Liquid Glass is unavailable. The owning display-group button tracks those visual segment regions and resolves hover from the same public global pointer geometry used for clicks; returning from the shelf performs one bounded pointer re-check during its dismissal grace so the segment rollover is restored even when AppKit omits the enter event. The visual children remain noninteractive.

Long names remain available to tooltips and VoiceOver while visible labels are bounded. Under severe notch or menu-bar pressure, Full first compacts labels, then hides inactive buttons deterministically behind a disclosed `+N` overflow while keeping every connected display and its active workspace visible. Missing display homes are not shown as connected and are never rewritten by this presentation layer. Existing private-install values migrate once: Compact and Icon Only become Compact, Active Workspace Label becomes Medium, and Full Workspace Strip becomes Full.

The choices deliberately combine a few proven patterns rather than copying a single product: AeroSpace exposes the current workspace in its tray icon, AeroSpork renders active per-monitor workspace chips, Loop uses a compact icon-led menu, and BetterStage allows selectable status content. WindowRanger keeps an always-accessible menu target in every mode so presentation choices cannot strand Settings or Quit. Every supported macOS release uses one standard status item per logical display group in every mode, without a redundant standalone app item. Each group moves as one menu-bar item and retains the system button's native press feedback. Compact and Medium group actions always open the menu. In Full, the standard button owns the action and resolves a primary workspace click from the public global pointer position against live screen-space segment frames; display, overflow, unresolved, secondary, Control-, and accessibility actions open the menu. No event monitor, private system process, or app-wide gesture override is used. Every menu action presents the same standard `NSMenu` through public AppKit APIs.

High-frequency command feedback uses one centered, pill-shaped, click-through nonactivating overlay rather than a status-item popover or notification banner. On macOS 26 and later it uses AppKit's native regular Liquid Glass surface; macOS 14–25 use the system HUD material fallback. It follows the resolved interaction display, never becomes key or main, coalesces rapid updates, and cleans itself up across display changes, sleep, and quit. Debug diagnostics record the overlay lifecycle and display decision without recording its message text. In Debug Settings, **Window Admission** can also show the engine's existing privacy-safe managed/floating/deferred/ignored classifications, reasons, matched built-in compatibility profile, modal/focus observations, window-control presence, and move/resize capability evidence. Built-in compatibility profiles correct verified unusual surfaces in popular apps automatically, including ChatGPT's transient update precursor; personal workspace and layout preferences remain user App Rules. The deterministic copied snapshot is suitable for regression-fixture capture. Refresh performs support-only Accessibility reads for already tracked windows without re-enumerating, moving, resizing, or focusing them; Copy uses that cached result. Neither includes titles, documents, URLs, paths, typed content, or window contents.

Switching to a workspace focuses an eligible window in that workspace on the resolved destination display. In Independent Displays mode, the workspace's logical home chooses which active-workspace slot changes, while its currently connected home or safe physical fallback chooses where focus is attempted; other displays remain untouched. Local focus history is preferred, then deterministic visible local order. If macOS rejects every destination focus attempt, a stale focus report for the just-parked source window cannot reverse the explicit workspace switch; a later explicit app activation still follows that app normally. An empty workspace does not focus a parked window or steal focus from another display. Unified mode retains the actual interaction display rather than defaulting to the main display.

When the target application is inactive, WindowRanger prepares and raises the exact destination
window, then uses the public application-level Accessibility frontmost attribute. It falls back to
AppKit activation only when that Accessibility write is rejected, and retains the same bounded exact-
window verification and generation cancellation for both paths. Already-active applications use
only the exact-window path and are not reactivated. If an active application temporarily exposes no
Accessibility focused window, verification succeeds only when WindowServer independently identifies
the exact requested window as that application's frontmost on-screen normal window; a reported AX
window mismatch or competing application still fails closed. The optional focused-window border uses
the target already proven by that focus transaction during the temporary AX gap. It independently
revalidates the active application and exact WindowServer window on every poll, and retains its
fullscreen and workspace filters, so it need not wait for the delayed focused-window attribute or
perform another focus action.

Physical display-role bindings are local to each Mac. The app first matches the stable runtime display UUID, then may use a portable vendor/model/serial fingerprint when reconnecting. If multiple identical displays match, it does not guess; the workspace's synced abstract home remains intact while its physical placement falls back safely until the user chooses a binding. Arrange-D swaps the current Independent Displays workspace onto the next connected role while keeping both displays' active-workspace invariants valid.

**Open at login** uses macOS's native login-item service and changes only after an explicit Settings toggle. **Automatically unhide applications when focusing their windows** is an opt-in compatibility setting, off by default, and throttles duplicate attempts to avoid activation loops. Automated tests inject substitutes and never alter the live login-item state.

Use the primary app menu's **Quit WindowRanger** command when testing quit recovery. Xcode's Stop button terminates the debug process immediately, so macOS does not give the app an opportunity to run synchronous cleanup; continuously saved state is used to recover on the next launch instead.

## Reproducing a cross-display focus jump

1. Gracefully quit the old build with the primary app menu's **Quit WindowRanger**.
2. In Xcode, keep the `WindowRanger` scheme on its normal Debug Run configuration and click Run.
3. Focus a managed window on the second display, then use Navigate-`,` / Navigate-`.` to cycle windows.
4. With the second-display window focused, use Arrange-`,` or Arrange-`.` to change its workspace layout.
5. If focus jumps to the main display, stop after one occurrence, Option-click the status item, and choose **Copy Recent Diagnostics**. The log can instead be inspected directly with **Reveal Diagnostics File** from the same Option-revealed section.

## Retesting sleep/wake recovery

1. Gracefully quit the currently running old build with the primary app menu's **Quit WindowRanger**.
2. In Xcode, select the normal `WindowRanger` scheme and Debug Run configuration, then click Run.
3. In Unified mode, put windows from visible and inactive workspaces on both displays, sleep the Mac,
   wake it, and confirm the active workspace is visible while inactive workspace windows remain parked.
4. Repeat in Independent Displays mode with a different active workspace on each display.
5. For the topology case, sleep while docked and wake undocked (then reconnect), or disconnect/reconnect
   the external display immediately around sleep. The laptop/main display is the temporary fallback;
   reconnecting must restore the external workspace home and its prior active selection.
6. If anything is wrong, reproduce once, Option-click the status item, and use **Copy Recent Diagnostics**. The correlated
   `lifecycle` records include the wake generation, topology, bounded enumeration and frame-verification
   attempts, deferred windows, expected/observed mismatch geometry, and final active-workspace map
   without window titles or document content.
