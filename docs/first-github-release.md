# First GitHub release

WindowRanger's first public binary is `v0.1.0-beta.1`, not a Stable release. The product remains
explicitly pre-release and several live, accessibility, privacy, and packaging gates remain open.

As of 10 August 2026, that exact Beta is Developer ID-signed, notarized, stapled, packaged, tested by
the maintainer, and published as a
[GitHub prerelease](https://github.com/AppRanger/windowranger/releases/tag/v0.1.0-beta.1). The tag
and artifacts remain at commit `04b5750b1fe3b183c1259d132a0a8e985f8b4e0e`.

This runbook uses a local-first release pipeline:

| Owner | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Local verification | While private, run exact-commit non-hosted checks through the opt-in pre-push hook and run the full uncredentialed checkpoint explicitly at integration/release boundaries. |
| GitHub Actions | Once public—or on an explicit private manual dispatch—generate the project, verify test isolation, run tests and static analysis, compile an unsigned universal Release configuration, and smoke-test both DMG layouts. |
| Maintainer's Mac | Use the Developer ID private key, archive/export, notarize, staple, package, and verify the exact release app and DMG. |
| GitHub Releases | Hold the immutable tag, draft notes, notarized DMG and ZIP, SHA-256 checksums, and provenance manifest. |

The daily installer is not a distribution tool. It deliberately builds a local development copy and
may use Apple Development signing. `scripts/build-distribution.sh` is the only scripted path for a
public binary.

## Repeat-release automation

`python3 scripts/release.py --help` exposes the repeat-release coordinator. It wraps the existing
scripts, reports progress, and retains command output and a provenance-bound journal under
`.build/release-runs/`. Commands preview by default; `--execute` runs the selected stage. Use the
same version, build number and exact source commit throughout a release. Read the printed plan
before execution. A failed stage stops the run; inspect its log before resuming. Existing partial
distribution output is never silently overwritten or treated as a successful build.
Command output goes to the printed log path by default, with elapsed-time heartbeats every
30 seconds. Use `--verbose` when diagnosing a failure; normal monitoring does not require
streaming compiler, upload or signature-verification logs into the conversation.

For example, after allocating the version/build and promoting the accepted source to clean
`main`, preview the build and asset verification together (replace every placeholder):

```sh
WINDOWRANGER_DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer \
python3 scripts/release.py --stage prepare \
  --version X.Y.Z --build-number NUMBER --commit FULL_RELEASE_COMMIT \
  --notary-profile WindowRanger \
  --notary-keychain "$HOME/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db" \
  --sparkle-public-key PUBLIC_EDDSA_KEY
```

Add `--execute` to perform that plan. Later stages use the same version/build/commit and
`--execute --resume`. `draft`, `verify-github`, `stage-feed`, `generate-feed`, `verify-feed` and
`cask-prepare` expose the remaining scripted checkpoints; their required inputs appear in
`--help`. The existing shell scripts remain usable directly for diagnosis.

This reduces command assembly and repetitive verification. It does not shorten Xcode compilation,
Apple notarization or remote uploads, and does not bypass their checks. Build-number allocation,
reviewed branch promotion, exact packaged-app acceptance, tag publication, GitHub publication,
and final release records remain explicit coordination steps. Website/tap promotion can use the
post-public coordinator below once those channel changes are authorized. The stage runner
does not change the installed app or silently publish a release. A saved successful verification
is historical evidence; rerun remote verification after publication to check the current channel.

### Post-public Stable channels

After the exact GitHub release is public and immutable, `scripts/release-channels.py` coordinates
the published ledger, website/feed PR and deployment, live verification, and Homebrew PR/audit.
It uses dedicated worktrees and records its progress under `.build/release-channel-runs/`.
It does not allocate a build, promote application source, publish GitHub, or install the app.

Create a local JSON configuration with the selected release's real paths and full commit:

```json
{
  "version": "X.Y.Z",
  "build_number": "NUMBER",
  "release_commit": "FULL_RELEASE_COMMIT",
  "source_repository": "/path/to/clean/release-source",
  "website_repository": "/path/to/website-repository",
  "tap_repository": "/path/to/homebrew-tap",
  "release_root": "/path/to/release-artifacts",
  "sparkle_bin": "/path/to/Sparkle/bin",
  "key_plist": "/path/to/release-app/Contents/Info.plist",
  "named_tap_checkout": "/opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/appranger/homebrew-tap"
}
```

Preview with `python3 scripts/release-channels.py --config /path/to/channels.json`.
After reviewing the configuration and authorizing these release checkpoints, add `--execute`.
An interrupted run uses the same file with `--execute --resume`; inspect the journal and error
before resuming. Ambiguous public mutations must be reconciled before retrying.
Release notes default to the release commit's `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md`. A custom `release_notes`
path requires an explicitly reviewed `release_notes_sha256` in the configuration. Tools default
to the release commit too; an explicit `tooling_commit` binds a separately reviewed tooling revision.

### Verification reuse

The required PR check retains the name `Verify source and unsigned build`. Push builds use
`Integration build and packaging` so their longer packaging run does not share the PR context.
Release analysis and the unsigned build share DerivedData. Application changes still run the
full non-hosted suite, with analysis/build/DMG gates on integration pushes.

Only additions/modifications to `TODO.md`, `docs/releases/*.md`, and `config/release-builds.tsv`
qualify as release bookkeeping. Those CI changes run the release/tooling checks without another
application compilation. Missing comparison bases, deletions, renames and other paths require
application verification. Local quick checks additionally require a successful receipt matching
the entire non-bookkeeping Git tree (including file modes) and Xcode/XcodeGen versions before
reusing application tests. Dirty checkouts cannot create or reuse this proof. `--full` and the
credentialed distribution checks retain their complete gates.

The next timed release must measure these changes against 1.0.8's 43m01s end-to-end baseline;
local tests establish behavior, not a demonstrated time or token saving.

For feed preparation, create a fresh directory from the selected website checkout:

```sh
python3 scripts/stage-release-feed.py \
  --public-directory /path/to/website/public \
  --destination /path/to/new-feed-workdir
```

The helper copies retained update artifacts into the flat layout expected by Sparkle, requires
every referenced payload, preserves the existing appcast, and reconstructs missing source release
notes from embedded descriptions. It rejects an existing destination. Generate the new signed feed
with the existing `generate-update-appcast.sh` workflow, then run `verify-appcast.py` against both
the local generated feed and the deployed feed. The independent verifier checks every full ZIP and
delta signature and length, optionally compares each payload with the local artifact, and writes
a machine-readable evidence report. Its expected version and build must be explicit; use
`python3 scripts/verify-appcast.py --help` for the exact arguments.

For local validation, use `verify-feed --local-only --artifact-directory /path/to/new-feed-workdir`
with the generated XML as `--feed`. After deployment, run `verify-feed` again with the HTTPS feed
URL and omit `--local-only`; keep the artifact directory to compare all downloaded bytes. This
stage currently verifies the default Stable channel. Beta generation is supported, but Beta
channel acceptance still follows the existing Sparkle runbook.

Verify this tooling independently of the macOS app tests:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_release.py'
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_appcast.py'
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_stage_release_feed.py'
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_verification_scope.py'
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_release_channels.py'
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_local_verification.py'
```

These checks cover orchestration and verification failure paths, not signing, notarization,
installed-app acceptance or a complete public release. Existing application and release gates
still run at their normal integration checkpoints.

## Why the first release is local

The maintainer's Mac already has the Apple account and local Keychain boundary needed for signing.
Keeping the first Developer ID private key and notarization credentials off GitHub makes the initial
workflow easier to inspect and debug. After at least one release is reproduced successfully, the
credentialed job can move to a protected GitHub Actions environment with required approval and
least-privilege secrets.

CI never turns an unsigned build into a public download and never receives signing or notarization
credentials in the current design.

## One-time Apple setup

1. Confirm the Apple Developer Program team and Account Holder that will own WindowRanger releases.
   The configured team is `44NAD22AK6`; do not release until that ownership is intentional.
2. Create and install a **Developer ID Application** certificate and its private key. An Apple
   Development certificate is not a distribution identity.
3. Ensure the WindowRanger App ID supports the required iCloud key-value entitlement. The release
   export uses automatic signing with `-allowProvisioningUpdates`, so Xcode creates or refreshes the
   direct Developer ID provisioning profile instead of relying on a locally named profile.
4. Store notarization credentials explicitly in the file-based login Keychain under a profile name
   such as `WindowRanger`. Supplying the keychain path avoids `notarytool`'s default Data Protection
   Keychain and makes the release script use the same deterministic store. For Apple ID
   authentication, run this interactively and substitute your own values:

   ```sh
   DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer \
   /usr/bin/xcrun notarytool store-credentials WindowRanger \
     --keychain "$HOME/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db" \
     --apple-id YOUR_APPLE_ID \
     --team-id 44NAD22AK6 \
     --validate
   ```

   Omitting `--password` makes `notarytool` request the app-specific password through its secure
   interactive prompt instead of placing it in shell history.

Never place the certificate, private key, app-specific password, App Store Connect key, or exported
`.p12` file in the repository.

## One-time Git setup

For the first Beta, complete and record these repository steps:

1. Create `develop` from the accepted `main` checkpoint, push it, and make it the default branch.
2. Preserve the recorded proof of automatic push and pull-request events. While private, automatic
   hosted jobs now skip to protect the included allowance; they resume when public.
3. Configure required checks and protection for `main`, `develop`, and release tags when GitHub Pro
   or public visibility makes rulesets available.
4. Cut `release/0.1.0` from `develop` and allow only release fixes, documentation, versioning, and
   packaging changes on that branch.

The branches and exact Beta tag now exist. Protection remains a public-visibility/GitHub-plan gate,
and automatic CI events must be evidenced independently of the manually dispatched release run.

Do not create the release branch or tags from a dirty worktree.

## Build and notarize the first Beta

Use stable Xcode. This Mac currently has stable Xcode at `/Applications/Xcode.app`; do not use the
selected Xcode beta for a public build.

Create a dedicated clean worktree so unrelated development changes cannot enter the release:

```sh
release_worktree="$(mktemp -d /tmp/windowranger-release.XXXXXX)"
git fetch origin
git worktree add "$release_worktree" release/0.1.0
cd "$release_worktree"
```

From that clean `release/0.1.0` worktree:

```sh
export WINDOWRANGER_DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

./scripts/install-dmg-tools.sh

./scripts/build-distribution.sh \
  --version 0.1.0-beta.1 \
  --build-number 1 \
  --notary-profile WindowRanger \
  --notary-keychain "$HOME/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db" \
  --preflight

./scripts/build-distribution.sh \
  --version 0.1.0-beta.1 \
  --build-number 1 \
  --notary-profile WindowRanger \
  --notary-keychain "$HOME/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db"
```

The build command:

1. refuses the wrong branch, a dirty worktree, Xcode beta, or a missing Developer ID identity;
2. generates the Xcode project and verifies the non-hosted test boundary;
3. runs the complete test suite and static analysis;
4. creates a universal Release archive with Hardened Runtime;
5. exports with Developer ID and rejects `get-task-allow`;
6. submits the app through `notarytool`, saves the accepted submission result and zero-issue log,
   staples the ticket, and validates it with `stapler` and Gatekeeper;
7. creates and Developer ID-signs the channel-specific DMG with the `/Applications` shortcut,
   saves its accepted notarization result and zero-issue log, staples its ticket, and verifies the
   disk image;
8. writes the final DMG, fallback ZIP, SHA-256 checksums, and provenance manifest beneath
   `.build/releases/0.1.0-beta.1/`.

Build number `1` is the first distribution build. Every later Beta or Stable artifact must use a
strictly larger integer.

## Test the exact artifact

Do not test a separate Xcode product and assume the release DMG is equivalent.

1. Open `WindowRanger-0.1.0-beta.1.dmg` on another supported Mac or a clean macOS user account.
2. Confirm the Beta construction artwork and instruction, then drag `WindowRanger.app` onto the
   `Applications` shortcut and launch it normally through Finder.
3. Verify Gatekeeper identifies the Developer ID publisher without an unidentified-developer
   override.
4. Complete the relevant manual regression, permission, multi-display, privacy, and recovery checks
   from `docs/release-checklist.md`.
5. Confirm the fallback ZIP contains the same signed and notarized app.
6. Confirm graceful quit and uninstall behaviour and capture only privacy-safe evidence.

Any source, build-setting, entitlement, signing, or packaged-content change after this test requires
a new build number and a newly notarized artifact. Documentation-only release-process improvements
may follow on `develop`, but they do not rewrite the immutable tag or claim to be inside its binary.

### Streamlined validation for repeat Betas

After the distribution pipeline has already produced and round-trip verified public Betas, a later
Beta may skip replacing the maintainer's currently installed daily copy with the packaged release
only when all of these conditions hold:

- the release contains no packaging, signing, entitlement, bundle-identity, migration, updater, or
  minimum-system change;
- every changed product path has already been exercised in a signed daily build from the same source
  tree and the result is recorded in `TODO.md`;
- the release branch contains only reviewed `develop` changes plus release notes and process records;
- the credentialed distribution script and public release CI complete without exceptions.

The streamlined path still requires the clean release worktree, stable Xcode, complete isolated
suite, static analysis, unsigned universal Release build, Developer ID archive/export, entitlement
and Debug-boundary checks, app and DMG notarization and stapling, Gatekeeper assessment, both DMG
layout smoke checks, ZIP equivalence, checksums, provenance manifest, immutable tag, and downloaded
five-asset round-trip verification. Review the release notes and verify the public download before
updating the website.

This shortcut is repeat-Beta evidence only. It does not complete the clean-user, clean-machine,
Accessibility migration, upgrade, uninstall, accessibility, privacy, or Stable manual matrices.
The first Beta, every Stable release, or any change to a distribution boundary must use the exact
packaged-artifact installation test above. Any unexpected verification result also restores that
test before publication.

## Tag and create the draft release

Only after the applicable exact-artifact or streamlined repeat-Beta validation passes:

```sh
git tag -a v0.1.0-beta.1 -m "WindowRanger 0.1.0 Beta 1"
git push origin v0.1.0-beta.1

./scripts/verify-release-assets.sh \
  --version 0.1.0-beta.1 \
  --expected-commit "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"

./scripts/create-github-release.sh \
  --version 0.1.0-beta.1 \
  --notes-file docs/releases/v0.1.0-beta.1.md
```

Use [the release-notes template](release-notes-template.md) as the starting point. The command
requires the pushed tag to point to `HEAD`, attaches the DMG, fallback ZIP, both checksums, and the
manifest, marks a Beta as a prerelease, and creates a **draft**. Before upload it validates the local
checksums, manifest, version and commit. It then downloads the five attached assets and repeats the
same verification against the immutable tag. It cannot publish the release or make the repository
public.

To repeat the round-trip verification without changing an existing draft or published release:

```sh
./scripts/create-github-release.sh --version 0.1.0-beta.1 --verify-existing
```

For a later release, review the draft on GitHub and explicitly publish it only after every applicable
gate for that release is complete. GitHub's automatically generated source archives are not the
macOS app and must not be described as the install download.

For an update-enabled release, follow [the Sparkle update runbook](sparkle-updates.md) after the
immutable release ZIP is available. Generating the local appcast, publishing the GitHub release,
and deploying the reviewed website appcast plus its checksum-identical update archives remain three
separate approval checkpoints.

For the first Stable release, follow [the Homebrew runbook](homebrew.md) only after the immutable
GitHub release and exact DMG are public. Cask generation, tap publication, and a future
`homebrew/cask` submission are separately reviewed checkpoints.

## Repository visibility

The repository became public on 10 August 2026 after the history/privacy scan, licence review,
private security and conduct reporting paths, branch protection, and tag rules were verified.
Changing visibility and publishing a draft remain separate, explicit maintainer actions for any
future private release repository.

## Moving release signing to CI later

After the local process is proven, a protected GitHub Actions environment can import an encrypted
Developer ID `.p12`, install the provisioning profile, use an App Store Connect/notary credential,
run the same script, and create the draft release. Require manual environment approval and grant the
job only `contents: write` when it is actually publishing.

Do not add those secrets to the ordinary pull-request workflow. Pull requests, especially from
forks, must remain unable to access release credentials.
